# Trojan GTK Launcher

The Greeks pretended to sail away, and the Trojans pulled the horse into their city as a victory trophy. Here is the pull.

This wraps your trojan in a GUI and puts it in your Linux system tray.

## Prerequisites
* Python 2 (sad but yes. It stinks in 2019 and still will be in 2020)
* python-appindicator
* python-vte

A sample install on Ubuntu 18.04:
```
sudo apt install python-minimal python-appindicator python-vte
```

## Usage
0. Copy everything to your trojan folder. Please make sure the config file is named `config.json`.
1. double click `trojan-gtk.desktop`.
2. Trust and run.
